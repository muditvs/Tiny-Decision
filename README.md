Tiny Decisions is a web application designed to help users make and reflect on important decisions. This tool allows users to record decisions, evaluate their pros and cons, set their current status, and later reflect on the outcomes. It also keeps track of all decisions made for future reference.

Features-

Decision Form: Add a new decision with a title, pros, cons, and a status ("Thinking" or "Made").

Decision History: View all decisions made, including their statuses and reflections.

Reflections: Update your final choice, explanation, and reflections on past decisions.

Storage: Decisions are stored in the browser's local storage, so data persists across sessions.
